# BMI-Calculator
This project is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator web application developed using Python's Flask framework. It allows users to input their weight and height to calculate their BMI and provides feedback on their weight category (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity) based on the calculated value.
